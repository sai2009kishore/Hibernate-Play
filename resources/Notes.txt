- Connection Pool Size indicated no.of parallel connections.
- The dialect in Hibernate specifies the language used to communicate with the Database.
- show_sql prints all the queries.
- hbm2ddl.auto specifies whether create, validate or update the table based on the Model at the start-up.
- @Basic specifies Hibernate that the configuration is default.
- Natural key has business significance. Surrogate key is only used to distinguish columns.
- Embedded and Embeddable for Objects.
- @AttributeOverride is used to change the name of the columns used with @Embedded
- If a list of Objects are specified using @ElementCollection, foreign keys are employed.
- @Enumerated is used to persist a value of Enum in DB.
- FetchType LAZY fetches the data as per requirement.
- @ElementCollection is used to define a Collection of objects in an Entity (Used for associations)
- For @ManyToMany relation, an intermediate table is used to maintain the ids of two tables.
  mappedBy is used to specify the variable that is used to map in other table.
- Cascade is used to perform operations automatically on dependent tables.
- Inheritance is supported while persisting the data.
- @Inheritance has SINGLE_TABLE strategy, i.e One table is used for all the classes in hierarchy.
  In TABLE_PER_CLASS strategy, each class has a single table in the DB.
  In JOINED strategy, each class has a different table, but child class will have parent class id instead of data.
   A join is performed to get the whole data.
- When there is an object with ID already set, hibernate assumes that we are using an object that was retrieved from the DB
   and throws an exception stating that the Object maybe detached.
- When we create an object, it is in Transient state, i.e. it is still not saved until we use save().
  When we save the object, it is persistent i.e. saved to the DB.
  When we perform a read operation, the object is still in persistent state because it is still in the DB.
  When we close the session, the object is detached i.e. though we have the object with data, it is detached from the DB
   and any operation will not be reflected.
- We can detach an object, modify it and then use it again to update.
  But this is not expected, as the object may not be in sync with the DB.
  So selectBeforeUpdate flag is used to fetch the data and update that data rather than having detached object's data.
- Parameter binding can be used to remove SQL injections.
- Named Queries can be written in classes and can be executed in the DB.
- Hibernate has First level cache i.e. the default cache level that doesn't execute duplicate queries.
- Cache can be configured i.e. second level cache wherein we can choose which Entity's data can be cached.
- Query cache is used to enable cache at HQL or native query level.
